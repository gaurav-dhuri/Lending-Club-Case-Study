## General Information
The main objective of this case study is to be able to identify the risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of financial loss to the company. 
Identification of such risky applicants or potential loan defaulters using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

## Conclusions
- People with lower annual income borrowing the loan with high interest rate for 36 months term, are more prone to be defaulters
- Borrowers with home ownership as mortgage and rent are more likely to be defaulters because the average annual income is relatively lower for these two categories. 
- Grades can be a good metric for detecting loan defaulters. The maximum loan defaulters are found to be mostly in grades B, C, D. Therefore lending club should re consider and verify the                 	borrowers who are applying loans for grades B, C and D.
- Region 9 has maximum number of loan defaulters, therefore lending club should examine all the borrowers who are applying loans from this region.
- Address state CA that falls under region 9 also has the maximum number of loan defaulters. Therefore lending club should control their numbers of loans being approved for this address 	state.
- The maximum number of loan defaulters borrowers have a employment length of 10 or more years. 
- The loan defaulters are maximum in the last quarter of the year, so the lending club should examine and control the loans being sanctioned in the last quarter of the year.
- The loan defaulters mostly have open accounts in the range of 5-15. Thus lending club should always verify the loan applicants with more than 5 open accounts.
- Negative correlation is observed between DTI and annual income, which means annual income is inversely proportional to DTI. Therefore lending club should be more cautious in granting - 	loans to borrowers who have higher DTI and lower annual income.
